## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Where did my notes go? I opened the app and nothing is there.

Your notes are stored wherever you keep them — FSNotes is just a client for your data. Managing and backing up your data is your responsibility. While the app allows you to conveniently create backups in Git, this does not work without initial setup.

If your notes are missing, check whether they were offloaded from your hard drive to the cloud. If an external drive is disconnected—connect it.

### 2. The app won’t start, what should I do?

Although FSNotes can handle thousands of files, there is still a limit. Try moving your notes from the storage folder to another location and then start the app again. The program might struggle with a large amount of data — return only the files you are actively working on later. If the app still doesn’t start, try [resetting preferences](https://github.com/glushchenko/fsnotes/wiki/Preferences-location).

### 3. Bring back RTF support and the horizontal notes list.

I won’t. Acting offended or threatening to switch to FSNotes 6 is useless. All the best.

### 4. I want feature Y — when will you add it?

Probably never. I’m busy fixing and maintaining what already exists. I suggest you make a pull request—everyone will appreciate it since this is an open-source project. You can also fork the project and develop it the way you want.

### 5. I have a good idea, how can I tell you about it?

Through GitHub discussions: https://github.com/glushchenko/fsnotes/discussions, and in the Telegram group: https://t.me/fsnotesapp. I read everything but can’t always reply. Sorry, I also have a life outside of the app, which I’ve already dedicated 9 years to.

### 6. There are no keyboard shortcuts, multi-window support, etc., on iPad.

That’s true. I do not support iPad — I don’t own one, and frankly, I consider it useless. The old build is only available in the App Store because Apple’s policies don’t allow it to be removed.
