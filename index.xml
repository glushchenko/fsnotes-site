New design The biggest design change in the history of the program. The new FSNotes adheres even more to Apple&amp;rsquo;s human interface guidelines. Branded icons, menus, toolbars, headers, animations and smooth transitions. Everything has become closer to the familiar Apple system programs.

The covid ended, the war began, I moved to Lviv, this post I am writing with no light at all. A huge series of events, among which it would seem there is no place for development. But luckily life hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped and today I am happy to present you a new major update for macOS, on which I&amp;rsquo;ve been working since May.</description></item><item><title>FSNotes 5 for iOS</title><link>https://fsnot.es/fsnotes5-for-ios/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2022 18:23:15 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://fsnot.es/fsnotes5-for-ios/</guid><description>Meet FSNotes 5 for Mobile!

Versioning If you accidentally erased part of the note, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. Now at any time you can return to the state until you entered the editor and roll back the changes, and you can also create a new version of the file at any time.</description></item><item><title>FSNotes 5 for macOS</title><link>https://fsnot.es/fsnotes5-for-mac/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2022 18:23:15 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://fsnot.es/fsnotes5-for-mac/</guid><description>All about FSNotes 5 Hello again! Almost two years have passed since the last major release, time flies by. Last summer, I pulled up FSNotes for iOS, and now it&amp;rsquo;s the turn of the macOS version of the program. A lot of work was done between 4 and 5, but for now I will focus on the innovations of the five.
The interface of the program has not changed much, but inside this update at least half a hundred bugs have been fixed.</description></item></channel></rss>
