Interface Transitions between controllers have become smoother and more native, this applies to both the main screen and the editor. Access to the settings has become easier.
To call up the action menu above the note, just hold your finger on the note (the sidebar must be closed).
Versioning If you accidentally erased part of the note, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. Now at any time you can return to the state until you entered the editor and roll back the changes, and you can also create a new version of the file at any time.</description></item><item><title>FSNotes 5 for macOS</title><link>https://fsnot.es/fsnotes5-for-mac/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2022 18:23:15 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://fsnot.es/fsnotes5-for-mac/</guid><description>All about FSNotes 5 Hello again! Almost two years have passed since the last major release, time flies by. Last summer, I pulled up FSNotes for iOS, and now it&amp;rsquo;s the turn of the macOS version of the program. A lot of work was done between 4 and 5, but for now I will focus on the innovations of the five.
The interface of the program has not changed much, but inside this update at least half a hundred bugs have been fixed.</description></item></channel></rss>
