&lt;h3 id="new-design">New design&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The biggest design change in the history of the program. The new FSNotes adheres even more to Apple&amp;rsquo;s human interface guidelines. Branded icons, menus, toolbars, headers, animations and smooth transitions. Everything has become closer to the familiar Apple system programs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to give a huge thanks to my friend Dylan Seeger for his valuable advice. Thanks to his ticketing, you see this update like this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>FSNotes 6 for macOS</title><link>https://fsnot.es/fsnotes6-for-mac/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2022 08:52:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://fsnot.es/fsnotes6-for-mac/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="all-about-fsnotes-6">All about FSNotes 6&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Hello everyone, it&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since the last big issue. The covid ended, the war began, I moved to Lviv, this post I am writing with no light at all. A huge series of events, among which it would seem there is no place for development. But luckily life hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped and today I am happy to present you a new major update for macOS, on which I&amp;rsquo;ve been working since May.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>FSNotes 5 for iOS</title><link>https://fsnot.es/fsnotes5-for-ios/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2022 18:23:15 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://fsnot.es/fsnotes5-for-ios/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="meet-fsnotes-5-for-mobile">Meet FSNotes 5 for Mobile!&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="interface">Interface&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Transitions between controllers have become smoother and more native, this applies to both the main screen and the editor. Access to the settings has become easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To call up the action menu above the note, just hold your finger on the note (the sidebar must be closed).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you accidentally erased part of the note, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. Now at any time you can return to the state until you entered the editor and roll back the changes, and you can also create a new version of the file at any time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>FSNotes 5 for macOS</title><link>https://fsnot.es/fsnotes5-for-mac/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2022 18:23:15 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://fsnot.es/fsnotes5-for-mac/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="all-about-fsnotes-5">All about FSNotes 5&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Hello again! Almost two years have passed since the last major release, time flies by. Last summer, I pulled up FSNotes for iOS, and now it&amp;rsquo;s the turn of the macOS version of the program. A lot of work was done between 4 and 5, but for now I will focus on the innovations of the five.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The interface of the program has not changed much, but inside this update at least half a hundred bugs have been fixed. Attribute caching makes switching between notes even smoother, and new features will not give a reason to return to the old version of the program.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
